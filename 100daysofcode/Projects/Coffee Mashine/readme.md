This is a simple Python program that simulates a coffee vending machine. You can select drinks, pay with coins, and the machine will check resources and prepare your coffee.

## How to Use

   - Navigate to the folder where the program is located.

2. **Run the Program**
   - Make sure you have Python 3 installed.
   - Run the following command:
     ```
     python main.py
     ```

3. **Follow the Prompts**
   - The program will ask:
     `What would you like? (espresso/latte/cappuccino):`
   - Type your choice and press Enter.
   - If you type `report`, you will see the current resources.
   - If you type `off`, the program will stop.

4. **Insert Coins**
   - The program will ask how many quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies you want to insert.
   - Enter the numbers as prompted.

5. **Receive Your Drink**
   - If there are enough resources and you inserted enough money, you will receive your drink.
   - If not, the program will notify you and refund your money if needed.
