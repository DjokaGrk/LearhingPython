# Leap Year Checker

This is a simple Python script that determines whether a given year is a leap year.

## About The Project

This script prompts the user to enter a year and then checks if it is a leap year based on the following rules:

1.  The year must be divisible by 4.
2.  If the year is divisible by 100, it must also be divisible by 400.

## How to Run

To run the script, execute the `leap_year.py` file from your terminal:

```bash
python leap_year.py
```

The program will ask you to input a year. After checking, it will print whether the year is a leap year or not. You will then have the option to check another year or exit the program.

## Project Structure

*   `leap_year.py`: The main Python script containing the logic for checking leap years.
